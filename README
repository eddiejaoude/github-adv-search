Proof of concept complete, demo http://github.jaoudestudios.com/

This project plans to extend GitHub's search by giving the user (un-authenticated) additional abilities:
- sorting/ordering by forks/watchers/activity etc
- filter results further


== Future plans ==
Authenticated users
- save search parameters
- notification alert (via email) when a new project is added that matches criteria
- bookmark projects, will not affect your watch list & will not appear in your feed
